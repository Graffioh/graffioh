Why am I making this post? What is life? Are we alone in the universe? I don't know.

As a Computer Science student, I used to have a wrong perception of the topic. I would often say things like, "They are not teaching me to code," "These math classes are useless," or "We'll never use Bézout's Theorem," and so on...

something clicked inside my head after watching this [video by Leslie Lampart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkZzg7Vowao) and this tweet by John Carmack:

I only had a vague idea of coding and nothing more when it came to my association with Computer Science.

Now I understand that we are studying **Computer Science**, not simply attending a coding bootcamp. Our purpose is to deeply understand the computer, starting from the math behind it all the way up to the concrete aspects. Sure, these things may seem boring to many of us, but I believe it's not a problem with the "subject" itself, but rather how we were educated in the years prior to university or college.
I have always had a lack of understanding in math, and even now, I still struggle with it. Because of this, I often perceive it as an unpleasant subject, but I realize it's simply because I am not proficient in it.

At the same time that my thinking was evolving, I realized that as a **Software Engineer**, it is crucial to satisfy clients by building a **product** for them. They don't care about how you wrote the code, which language you used, or what architecture you chose. It is important to focus on the right things rather than getting caught up in questions like, "What IDE/Editor should I use?" or "What is the best keyboard?" or "I want to use X programming language, but Y is more suitable for the job (mostly because it's faster to develop with it)." All these things are meaningless. Choose what works best for you, but remember that delivering a product is what truly matters.

The key is to build things and strive to create meaningful products for people. The tool doesn't matter, what truly matters is adaptability. I'm not saying this just for the sake of it, but for me, it applies to everything in our field. For example, I'm not scared of AI and all of this nonsense. If it becomes my assistant, it's just another tool for me to use in my work, and that's a good thing.
