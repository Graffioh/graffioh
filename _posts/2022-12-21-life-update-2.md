Yo it's been a while!

{% include figure.html path="assets/img/graffioh-recap-2022.png" title="img" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

So, what happened during these months? The usual stuffs: gym, university, friends and coding.

This is gonna be a quick recap of what I did and what I learnt, if you don't care, it's fine don't worry :)

## Summer
While studying for discrete math exam (actual torture), I did a simple game with SFML and C++ in my spare time. I got a lot of knowledge and I really enjoyed developing it. Of course it's basic C++ with some C++11 features, nothing advanced. 

The name is ArcAim and this is the [repo](https://github.com/Graffioh/ArcAim) on github. (There are also videos!)

This project will not be left over, I'll try to update it as much as possible, but new things are behind the corner, so who knows.

## Autumn/Winter
University started, Apple course started, pain started (jk).

So during this time, I met a lot of people (foreigners and not), got better in english and improved my professional skills like presenting a product to an audience and building something in a team.

There are some private *things* that I can't share, but also public ones like:

+ A photo editing app clone: [repo+video](https://github.com/Graffioh/PhotoEditAppClone)
+ A chat app: [repo+video](https://github.com/Graffioh/AirChat)

What I learnt? 

+ Swift
+ Git workflow in team 
+ Project management with various time constraints
+ A little bit of design

## Future
Remember:

The future is <ins>not certain</ins>, the future <ins>is dark</ins>, there will be <ins>hard times</ins>, but we must step over them and <ins>go on</ins>.
