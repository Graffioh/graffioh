# The journey so far

The focus of this journey is to get a good understanding of how an anti-cheat work and how to develop it especially for FPS games.

Even though I have university, I preferred to do a "side" project instead of studying only for the exams, because **for me**, if you will graduate without any side project, you wont get very far.

So lets begin!

I started with tutorials on [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/), a powerful memory tool for game hackers that is really straightforward.

From there I got a lot of knowledge, from the basic memory concepts to assembly and reverse engineering.

After having a good level of confidence with CE (Cheat engine), I started to look for cheat forums as I wanted to go more in depth with External/Internal Cheats.

I stumbled across [Unknown Cheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/index.php) and [Guided Hacking](https://guidedhacking.com/). I saw that Guided Hacking changed during the time, it was completely free, but now you need to donate like 15 euros to view posts and download sources.

I wasn't really into it, I didn't want to spend money for things that you can actually learn for free in these days, so I went for Unknown Cheats.

There I started basic external tutorials, with Windows API, in concomitance with [Windows Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189/ref=sr_1_1?crid=VCH9SCIRFZDR&keywords=windows+internals+part+1&qid=1654597554&s=books&sprefix=windows+internals+part%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C140&sr=1-1), a really great book by Pavel Yosifovich.

I really liked studying these things, so I decided to donate to Guided Hacking for a yearly subscription, as they had a really good "path" to follow.

After some experience with External cheats and C++, I went into Internal Cheats as I liked it more, yeah....I like pointers.

In addition to getting experience with Internal Cheats and C++, I started using [REClass.NET](https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET/tree/96b36cf7a97d41863b6d75098f681615884d55f7), debuggers like [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) and a disassembler.

For the disassembler I use IDA. (not Ghidra because for IDA there a lot of resources online + plugins).

Following Guided Hacking tutorial I reversed [Assault Cube](https://assault.cubers.net/), and made an Internal cheats with no recoil, flyhack, god mode and other things, some of them works in multiplayers and some of them don't.

Now I am "reversing" CS:GO (of course still following tutorials but not copy-pasting), with quite a bit of difficulty, but I'm sure I will get through this too.

This is not an easy journey, and I like hard things (no contradictions).
