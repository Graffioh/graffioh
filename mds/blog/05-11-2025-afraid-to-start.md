# Afraid to start

I often see many people coming up with various random reasons just because they are afraid to start. I used to be one of them.

At first, I was hesitant to begin with LeetCode because I thought I wasn’t smart enough and lacked algorithm fundamentals. But when the interview period arrived, I had no choice but to dive in. I struggled a lot, and I still do, but as a result, I am definitely better than when I started.

For several months I was afraid to start with AI as well and there were multiple reasons:

1.	I thought I wouldn’t understand anything due to my weak math foundations.
2.	I didn’t want to jump on the hype wagon.
3.	I was focused on LeetCode after work, preparing for a future newgrad job.

But now I’ve started, I feel a strong urge to learn more every day without getting bored. I haven’t felt this way since I was developing vvvdeo. I began because I’m genuinely fascinated by the (statistical) magic that AI brings. I want to explore further, understand research papers and new discoveries without feeling like an outsider, and contribute to AI discussions with the RAGa (⌐■_■).

It's not really important where you start. Just pick one of the starting points (high level, low level or a mix of both) and then BFS/DFS through the various levels. After you start, you'll start building the knowledge piece by piece.

Don’t get stuck. Always keep doing something, because through action comes learning, and through learning comes **knowledge**.
