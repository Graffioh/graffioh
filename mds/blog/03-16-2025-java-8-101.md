## Introduction

Java is based on the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which makes it portable across multiple architectures (and historically slow, portraying Java as a language with poor performance).

If you want to dive deeper, you can read about the JVM and other intrinsic mechanism on the internet (or maybe wait for a future post of mine).

Before starting, you need basic OOP knowledge...Why? Because from now on everything will be an object. We will turn into objects as well, so not be scared.

In Java everything is a class, and a class is basically a blueprints for creating objects. When a class is instantiated using the new keyword, an object is created in the heap memory, which is the dynamic memory area where objects live until they are garbage collected.
Simultaneously a reference to this object is stored in the stack memory, which is a smaller and faster memory area that handles method calls and local variables.
For example when ```Car myCar = new Car()``` is executed, the myCar reference is stored in the stack, while the actual Car object is created in the heap.

## Type system

Java is a statically typed language aka *every expression type must be known at compile time and for each expression the type represent all the possible values that can be attributed to*.

A type can be:

- **declared** (static): the type attributed to the expression during the declaration.
- **effective** (dynamic): the type attributed to the expression during the runtime, while doing polymorphism and other runtime specific type mechanism.

### Subtype rules & Polymorphism

I mentioned **Polymorphism** before, what's that? It's a way to implement [Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)#:~:text=In%20object%2Doriented%20programming%2C%20inheritance,inheritance%2C%20retaining%20similar%20implementation.).

Thanks to the subtype rules, we know when the polymorphism happens, without giving errors.

Considering T and U as types:

0) T *is a subtype of* himself
2) T *is a subtype of* Object
1) T *is a subtype of* U if T implements or extends U
3) null *is a subtype of* T
4) if T *is a subtype of* U => T[] *is a subtype of* U[]

These also shapes:

- the ```ìnstanceof``` behavior: ```(object of type T) instanceof U``` gives false if it's null or if T is not a subtype of U.
- the **Assignable** relation: a type T is assignable to a type U if T is a subtype of U or if T and U are primitive types.

### Primitive types

I actually lied to you, not everything is a object.

Primitive types are not objects. You can cast primitive types by doing implicit or explicit casts:

- **Implicit** casting is done only if this graph below is followed:

![java-types-graph](../../java/java-cast-types.png)

- **Explicit** cast is done manually, but you could actually lose valuable informations (f.e. casting from ```double``` to ```int```)

### Wrapper types

These are objects, and as the name suggest, they *Wrap* values, by offering methods and every benefit of objects to basic types.

They are **immutable** and **final**, so you can't directly modify its value after the declaration. Instead it will create a new Wrapper object (and reference) everytime you try to change the value.

#### Autoboxing and Unboxing

Mechanism that automatically convert during runtime a basic type into a Wrapper during a declaration using the static method ```valueOf``` implicitly:

```java
Integer n = 7 // Integer n = Integer.valueOf(7)
```

## Enumeration

This is basically a class with a fixed set of possible values that an instance can take, with each value having an 'id' called **ordinal**. That's it.

The enum values need to be declared first, the values can be accessed thanks to its name with ```valueOf(Class, name)``` and the ordinal can be accessed using the ```ordinal()``` method, which provides the id of the enum constant in the order they are declared.

You can also add custom constructors and methods, as shown in the example below:

```java
public enum SuitEnum {
    HEARTS(true), SPADES(false), CLUBS(false), DIAMONDS(true);

    private final boolean red;

    private SuitEnum(boolean red) {
        this.red = red;
    }

    public boolean isRed() {
        return red;
    }
}

SuitEnum x = SuitEnum.DIAMONDS;
int i = x.ordinal();
String name = x.name();

SuitEnum y = Enum.<SuitEnum>valueOf(SuitEnum.class, "HEARTS");
```

## Exceptions

There are two types of exceptions:

- **Checked**: these are caused by external factors (f.e. ```FileNotFoundException```), needs to be handled with a try...catch() or by declaring the throws on the method, so the compiler doesn't complain.
- **Unchecked**: these are caused by the programmer (f.e. ```ArrayOutOfBoundsException```), the compiler doesn't complain if you don't handle them beforehand but causes runtime errors.

```RuntimeException``` and exceptions that extends ```Error``` are unchecked, whereas all the others from the standard library are checked.

![java-exceptions-tree](../../java/java-tree-exceptions.png)

## Reflection

It's the mechanism used by Java to investigate about type informations during runtime, thanks to the class ```Class```.

There are a few gotchas:

- Only the JVM can instantiate the class Class
- The JVM instantiate an object Class for each new class stored in memory
- An object of type Class contains the informations about the class: constructors, methods, fields and internal classes.

There are a few usable methods (check the [docs](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=class+java&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)), the most important one being `getClass()`, which gives the runtime type.

One thing to note is that ```getClass()``` differs from `instanceof`, because the former is based on the dynamic type, whereas the latter is based on the static type.

## Equality check

So there is a twist here: ```==``` it's different from other languages.

If you use ```==``` while comparing primitive types, it works as intended, but if it's being used with Objects, it will actually compare the references on the Heap and not act as a *real* object equality.

So, how do you perform an equality check for objects? By using the ```equals()``` method.

This method must respect the **Equality relation properties**:

- *Reflexive*: x.equals(x) is true
- *Symmetric*: x.equals(y) is true <=> y.equals(x) is true
- *Transitive*: x.equals(y) is true && y.equals(z) is true => x.equals(z) is true

And there are three types of **Equality criterions**:

- *Uniform*: all the subclasses inherit the equals() method of the superclass.
- *Non-uniform*: the subclasses overrides the equals() method to give it custom behaviour.
- *Mixed*: a mix of the above.

This is an example of how to re-define the equals() method for non-uniform criterion, considering Manager that extends Employee:

```java
// Employee
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) return false;
    if (o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;
    Employee e = (Employee) o;

    // ...
}

// Manager
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!super.equals(o)) return false;
    Manager m = (Manager) o;

    // ...
}
```

## Internal, Local, Anonymous Classes & Lambda expressions

### Internal class

These are classes defined inside other classes, to organize better the inheritance structure.

```java
public class A {
    private class B {
        // ...
    }

    class C {
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here B is only visible in A and C is visible to all the classes inside the same package of A.

These classes can be accessed via ```A.B``` or ```A.C``` syntax.

### Local class

These are classes defined locally, inside a method, that after the scope are destroyed.

```java
class MyActionListener implements ActionListener {
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        label.setText("Vibe coding is slop")
    }
}

b.addActionListener(new MyActionListener());
```

### Anonymous class

These are basically local classes, but without a name, that's why they are called anonymous.

They are used to instantiate an object that will be used inside other existing classes or interfaces, and that will die after its declaration.

For example, following the example of a local class, we can rewrite the thing like this:

```java
b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        label.setText("Vibe coding is slop")
    }
})
```

### Lambda

Lambdas are a way to define anonymous classes in a more compact way by using the [lambda calculus](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/) design.

You can use lambda when implementing **Functional Interfaces** (interfaces with only 1 abstract method).

Let's write the example above but with lambdas:

```java
b.addActionListener(() -> {
    label.setText("Vibe coding is slop")
})
```

Neat, right? This is not an exhaustive example on what you can do with them, so dig deeper by yourself. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIXs4Y8sJCk&list=PLL8woMHwr36HQhhPPdV_T8rigbuywMpD7) to help you start.

## Generics

Always from the same guy, there is this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKWw7J5MsyY) that explains the concept in a good and coincise way but I'll also explain it here in the best and simplest way I can.

Generics are a way to implement 'dynamic' polymorphism. They are present in almost every modern language and are used to write modular code. The type checking runs during compile time, so they also guarantee type-safety.

Thanks to this feature, it's possible to write classes or methods that changes their behavior based on the type provided.

The basic syntax is:

```java
// Class
class Example<T> {
    T element;
    // ...
}

class Example<T, U> {
    // Here the elements types could be different
    T element1;
    U element2;
    // ...
}

// Method
<T> T exampleMethod(T el1, T el2) {} // return and inputs type T

<T, S> T exampleMethod(T el1, S el2) {} // return type T and inputs type T and S
```

But this is limited to the actual type, without much flexibility. To give the class or method more flexibility we will use: extends, super and wildcards.

### Upper bound type

This is used to give the power of inheritance to generics.

Let's suppose we have a method that accept Employee and all of his subclasses

```java
public void giveSalary(ArrayList<Employee> listOfEmployees) { /*...*/ }
```

Would this work? NO, because generics are **Invariants** and that means that polymorphism wont work, if something it's of type T, then only type T could be assigned.

It comes to our help the upper bound, ```<T extends U>``` , this tell the compiler that T can be U or a subtype of U.

So to make the example before work, we can use it by doing:

```java
public <T extends Employee> void giveSalary(ArrayList<T> listOfEmployees) { /*...*/ }
```

By using this you'll gain more flexibility but it's still somewhat restricted and we want more! (however keep in mind that sometimes the more, the worst.)

### Wildcards

Wildcards gives a lot of flexibility but also imposes some costraints since they can't be known at compile-time.

There are three types: Jolly (or Unbounded), Upper bounded and Lower bounded.

![wildcards-graph](../../java/wildcards-graph.png)

#### Jolly

```?``` aka some unknown generic type aka the supertype common to everything.

Let's say we have ```List<?>``` , we can assign to it every possible List: ```List<Employee>, List<Manager>, List<String>...```

But it's not that good to use only jolly types because they imposes two conditions when calling methods:

- If a method of a ```A<T>``` accept an argument of type T and we use a reference of type ```A<?>``` then only null can be passed to it since the compiler can't infere the actual type.
- If a method of a ```A<T>``` return a value of type T and we use this method on a reference of type ```A<?>``` then we can assign the returned value only to ```Object```.

A bit confusing, so let's clarify this with an example regarding ```LinkedList<T>``` :

```java
// Let's suppose we pass a LinkedList<Integer> to this
public static void moveHeadToTail(LinkedList<?> l) {
    Object head = l.removeFirst(); // accepted
    Integer head = l.removeFirst(); // compilation error

    l.addLast(3); // compilation error
    l.addLast(null); // accepted
}
```

I hope everything now is more clear.

#### Upper bounded

```<? extends T>``` aka an unknown type (the common supertype of everything) that extends T


```java
// Let's suppose we pass a LinkedList<Integer> to this
public <T> static void moveHeadToTail(LinkedList<? extends T> l) {
    SubclassOfInteger head = l.removeFirst(); // accepted
    Integer head = l.removeFirst(); // accepted 

    l.addLast(3); // compilation error
    l.addLast(null); // accepted
}
```

#### Lower bounded

```<? super T>``` aka an unknown type that is supertype of T

Similar to the Jolly type, there are constraints for these two types when calling methods. 

```java
// Let's suppose we pass a LinkedList<Integer> to this
public <T> static void moveHeadToTail(LinkedList<? super T> l) {
    SubclassOfInteger head = l.removeFirst(); // not accepted, compilation error
    Integer head = l.removeFirst(); // accepted

    l.addLast(3); // accepted
    l.addLast(new SubclassOfInteger(69)); // accepted
    l.addLast(null); // accepted
}
```

Below is a table that summarizes the three types:

![wildcards-table](../../java/wildcards-table.png)

#### Guarantees

And these are also important guarantess that the wildcards offer:

- The upper bounded type, provides a **Read-only guarantee** where you can read items from the collection, but you cannot add items to it (except for null).
- The lower bounded type, provides a **Write-only guarantee** where you can add items from the collection, but you cannot read items (except for Object).
- The jolly type, guarantee that you can't Read or Write.

### Erasure

Generics, at compile-time, will be **erased** (after proper type-checking) and replaced by casts of the actual type, the so called **Type Erasure**. That's how Java implements Generics.

So ```List<String>``` and ```List<Integer>``` will both be represented as ```List``` at runtime, losing the actual generic type information.

This reduce the overhead since the bytecode won't contain anything resembling generics (just the opposite of C++ **Reification**). If you want more details about the comparison between the two approaches, follow this [link](https://gist.github.com/championswimmer/da30db04850dfbdbbedb37b24a68d005).

## Design by Contract

This is not really a Java related thing, but it could be useful to write more organized and maintainable code.

I'll only talk about method contracts but this could also be applied to classes/interfaces and so on.

A good method must be **complete** (respect the *precondition*) and **correct** (respect the *postcondition*)

If a method is being overriden by subclasses, the parent contract must be respected.

### Precondition vs Postcondition

The **Precondition** are conditions that must be true BEFORE a method is executed. These typically involve the input parameters and the state of the system. Whereas **Postcondition** are conditions that must be true AFTER the method has executed, assuming the preconditions were met. These describe the expected state of the system and the output of the method.

### Completeness vs Correctness

**Completeness** is when a method accept all possible valid inputs, whereas **Correctness** is when a method never accept invalid inputs (inputs that don't satisfy the precondition).

You can't always define a method that it's both complete and correct, so you must decide if you want the method to be more robust (correct) or if you want it to be more flexible (complete).

## Iterable and Iterator

![java-iterable-iterator](../../java/java-iterable-iterator.png)

The `Iterable` interface is implemented by a structure that is intended to be *iterated over*.

The `Iterator` interface, when implemented, acts as a pointer within the structure, with specific methods that need to be defined: `hasNext()`, `next()`, and others. For more information, you can refer to the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html).

```java
// Iterable
public class CustomIterable implements Iterable<...> {
    public CustomIterable(...) {
        // ...
    }

    // Iterator (this also can be defined in his own class file)
    @Override
    public Iterator<...> iterator() {
        // ...
    }

    private class CustomIterator implements Iterator<...> {
        private int currentIndex = 0;

        @Override
        public boolean hasNext() {
            // return true if there are other elements in the structure
        }

        @Override
        public String next() {
            if (!hasNext()) {
                throw new NoSuchElementException();
            }

            // return the next element
        }
    }

```

Note: If you want to use enhanced for loop (```for(T el : structure) {}```), the structure that will be iterated needs to implement ```Iterable```.

## Comparable and Comparator

The `Comparable` interface is used when a structure is ordered according to its natural ordering, which is typically defined for types such as Numbers, Strings, etc.

The `Comparator` interface is used when a structure can be ordered in multiple ways (based on a custom comparator that we implement) or if we do not want to modify the natural ordering implementation.

```java
// Comparable
public class Employee implements Comparable<Employee> {
    private int salary;
    private String name;

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Employee x) {
        return name.compareTo(x.name) // Here we are using the natural ordering offered by String type (lexicographically)
    }
}

//Comparator
public class Employee {
    private int salary;
    private String name;

    // Here compareTo it's used but you could've written something that adhere to ordering properties and rules
    public static final Comparator<Employee> comparatorByName = new Comparator<>() {
        public int compare(Employee a, Employee b) {
            return a.name.compareTo(b.name);
        }
    };

    public static final Comparator<Employee> comparatorBySalary = new Comparator<>() {
        public int compare(Employee a, Employee b) {
            return a.salary.compareTo(b.salary);
        }
    };
}
```

![java-comparable-comparator](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*zeTUgb3jpIfN4nuw36BCEw.png)

This tables give a quick and useful overview, and as we can see, one uses ```compareTo()``` and the other one ```compare()```.

If you want to dive deeper, as before, go read the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html).

### Ordering properties and rules

When using a custom `Comparator` with elements a b c, and the `sgn()` function that returns the sign of the result, the `compare()` method must adhere to the following properties:
- **Reflexive and Antisymmetric**: sgn(c.compare(a,b)) == -sgn(c.compare(b,a))
- **Transitive**: c.compare(a,b) < 0 and c.compare(b,c) < 0 => c.compare(a,c) < 0
- **Extra**: if sgn(c.compare(a,b)) == 0 => sgn(c.compare(a,c)) == sgn(c.compare(b,c))

And the rules are that:
- if a < b then a negative number is returned
- if a == b then 0 is returned
- if a > b then a positive number is returned

## JFC (Java Collection Framework)

If you want to use pre-defined data structures, you'll pick one that implements the Collection interface.

That's useful for leetcode nerds that use Java (I have no words for you).

![collection-diagram](../../java/collection-diagram.png)

These collections, as we can see from the diagram, also implement `Iterable`, which means that they can be iterated using the enhanced for loop.

It would be too much of a burden to explain every collection, so I'll just link the cheat sheet that you can consult yourself -> [here](https://i0.wp.com/javaconceptoftheday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Java_Collections_Cheat_Sheet.png?fit=1100%2C1825&ssl=1).

## Multi-threading

Before reading this section, you should be comfortable with the main concepts of concurrency.

What you need to know, even at a high level, is: Threads, Race conditions and Mutex locks.

### Threads in Java

Here, you must not confuse the `Thread` object with a thread that is executing.

The `Thread` object is used for everything related to threads. A `Thread` object may or may not have an associated executing thread (it could be finished or yet to start), whereas an executing thread must be associated with a `Thread` object.

But how can we create & execute these threads then?

```java
// extending Thread (not recommended, since you can only extend Thread and nothing else)
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello zoomers from MyThread that extends Thread.");
    }
}

MyThread tMyThread = new MyThread();

// Runnable (Functional interface that contains only run() as an abstract method)
Runnable r = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello zoomers from Runnable.");
    }
}

Thread tRunnable = new Thread(r);

// Lambda
Thread tLambda = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Hello zoomers from Lambda.");
})

// Let's execute the threads
tMyThread.start(); tRunnable.start(); tLambda.start();
```

The main methods other than ```start()```, are:

- ```join()```, used by other threads to signal that they are waiting the thread joined before finishing their execution.
- ```sleep(milliseconds)```, static method used to sleep the current thread where it's being called.
- ```currentThread()```, static method used to get the current thread, as its name suggest.
- ```interrupt()```, used to stop a thread, it sets an internal flag to true, and this flag acts as a signal to the thread that it has been interrupted (signal sent only after a *blocking call* is executed).

### JMM (Java Memory Model)

This is how Java represents and manage memory access in a multi-threaded environment. They define useful rules for the programmer that needs to do nitty gritty concurrent operations.

The rules are:

- **Atomicity**: which operations are naturally atomics.
- **Visibility**: when a memory write become visibile to other threads.
- **Order**: in which order the operations are executed.

### Volatile keyword

This keyword is used on a field class to give visibility (and 'partial atomicity' following atomicity rules). Other threads usually due to caching and other instrinsic mechanism have difficulty seeing changes between other threads, to dig deeper watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYIEqt-jvY).

```java
public volatile Integer salary;
```

Now reads and writes (not together, f.e. this not applies to salary++) will be atomic and visible to all the threads.

### Thread-safety

RACE CONDITIOOOOOONS, we must prevent them, we must ensure thread safety, it's our job, till death.

There are a lot of ways to do that, there are specific data structures and types (like `AtomicInteger`) that are thread-safe implicitly but I'll focus mostly on basic constructs.

#### Synchronized

This keyword can be applied to methods or code blocks, ensuring mutex between locks.

```java
// Method
public synchronized void addSalary() { }

// Code block
synchronized(lock) { }

```

The lock must be specified, and you can follow this to choose which lock to use:

- `synchronized(this)`: This is used to synchronize access to a block of code or method within the same instance of a class. It ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized code on the same instance at a time.

```java
public void method() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Critical section guarded by the instance lock
    }
}
```

- `synchronized(objLock)`: By creating an additional field of type `Object` to act as a lock, you can synchronize access between multiple threads using the same lock object.

```java
private final Object objLock = new Object();

public void method() {
    synchronized(objLock) {
        // Critical section guarded by objLock
    }
}
```

- `synchronized(MyClass.class)`: This is used to synchronize access across all instances of the class. It ensures that only one thread can execute the synchronized code for any instance of the class at a time.

```java
public void method() {
    synchronized(MyClass.class) {
        // Critical section guarded by the class lock
    }
}
```

Note: the synchronized when used on methods act as a lock on the instance, so it's implicitly using 'this'.

#### Condition variables

In Java we don't have explicit condition variables constructs. Instead methods on objects are used.

These methods must be called on objects where the lock is obtained by the method, so for example, in synchronized blocks (otherwise it will throw a `IllegalMonitorStateException`).

The methods are:

- `wait()`, used to do a **passive wait** (since doing an active wait with while(true) it's not a good choice, you know), that make the thread wait for a notify call (or an InterruptedException as explained later).
- `notify()`, used to wakeup only a single thread that it's currently waiting (not recommended).
- `notifyAll()`, used to wakeup all waiting threads.

So these condition variables could be used on the famous ['Producer-Consumer' problem](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19120-01/open.solaris/816-5137/6mba5vq4p/index.html) for proper synchronization.

An exceptional case called **spurious wakeup** can occur due to compatibility issues with OS signals (such as on Linux), where threads may be awakened even without a notify()/notifyAll() call.

#### Blocking calls

There are calls that are **blocking**, where the current thread execution is paused until the blocking operation completes.

These calls include `wait(), Thread.sleep(ms), join()`, and they throw InterruptedException which must be handled.

This `InterruptedException` occur when we call `interrupt()` and the interrupted flag is set to true (refer to [this section](#threads-in-java)).

#### Extra: ReentrantReadWriteLock

This is used when you want to allow multiple threads to read when no other thread is performing a write operation. There is no need to block threads when all threads are reading since no race conditions can occur.

To init this we basically need a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` and two locks, one to read and one to write:

```java
ReadWriteLock rwLock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
Lock rLock = rwLock.readLock();
Lock wLock = rwLock.writeLock();
```

And then we use `lock()` to take the lock and `unlock()` to release the lock after the operations in the critical section.

## Extra: A bit of Async

This is an additional section. I'll probably write separate posts to explain the whole concept of async programming better once I gain more experience with it. However I think it's a good idea to provide a brief introduction here (which will also serve as a reminder for me to write a 'future' post).

My reference will be [this article](https://concurrencydeepdives.com/guide-completable-future/).

Asynchronous programming is everywhere nowadays thanks to the internet and network calls. They are 'unpredictable', due to various external factors, that's why we need a way to handle them correctly.

`Future` and `CompletableFuture` are used to manage async tasks. If you are familiar with Javascript, you will find similarity with the 'Promise' object and 'then' chaining.

### Future & CompletableFuture

- '`Future` appeared in Java 5 (2004) and its an interface. Its a placeholder for a value which is not yet available. Once it is available – perhaps because the computation that computes it terminated – the future will contain said value.'
- '`CompletableFuture` CompletableFuture appeared in Java 8 (2014). It implements the Future interface, but adds much more functionality'.

These definitions present in the reference article are really clear, useless for me to rephrase them.

Before finishing, I'll give the comparison between Javascript Promises and Java CompletableFuture (kindly offered by claude):

Javascript:

```js
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
```

Java:

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
    // Simulate fetching data
    return fetchDataFromApi();
}).thenApply(data -> {
    // Process the data
    return processData(data);
}).thenAccept(result -> {
    // Use the result
    System.out.println(result);
}).exceptionally(ex -> {
    // Handle exceptions
    System.err.println("Error: " + ex.getMessage());
    return null;
});
```

## End

I hope you enjoy this post and that it helps you refresh your knowledge or introduces you to these various Java 8 concepts.
